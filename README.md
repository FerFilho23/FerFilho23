## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fernando.

I'm a Software Engineer with +3 years of experience across Cloud Development and Data Engineering. I recently earned my B.E. in Computer Engineering at UNICAMP, one of the top LATAM universities, and certifications from Oracle on Cloud and Data Science.

During my career, I have worked with multiple programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and technologies such as Python, SQL, Flask, FastAPI, Django, REST APIs, Docker, TensorFlow, OpenAI API, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud.

My interests range from designing cloud architectures and data pipelines to machine learning and LLMs, and I'm always eager to explore new technological horizons.

I am excited about opportunities where I can apply my diverse technical skills, collaborate with talented teams, and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of technology. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss new opportunities!
